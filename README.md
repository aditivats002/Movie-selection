# Movie Selection Project

## Overview
The Movie Selection Project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings. The system leverages a dataset of movie ratings to suggest films that users are likely to enjoy. This README file provides an overview of the project, dataset, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of movie ratings provided by users. Each row in the dataset represents a user's rating for a particular movie. The ratings are typically integers ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the lowest rating and 5 indicates the highest rating.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset typically includes the following columns:

- `user_id`: A unique identifier for each user.
- `movie_id`: A unique identifier for each movie.
- `rating`: The rating given by the user to the movie (integer from 1 to 5).
- `timestamp`: The time when the rating was given (optional).

Example:
```
user_id, movie_id, rating, timestamp
1, 101, 5, 964982703
1, 102, 3, 964981247
2, 101, 4, 964982224
...
```

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movieselection.git
   cd movieselection
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset:** Ensure that your dataset is in the appropriate format (CSV) and contains the necessary columns (`user_id`, `movie_id`, `rating`, `timestamp`).

2. **Load the dataset:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ratings = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/dataset.csv')
   ```

3. **Train the recommendation model:** Use the provided scripts or notebooks to train the recommendation model on your dataset.
   ```python
   from recommendation_model import train_model
   model = train_model(ratings)
   ```

4. **Get movie recommendations:**
   ```python
   from recommendation_model import recommend_movies
   user_id = 1
   recommendations = recommend_movies(model, user_id)
   print(recommendations)
   ```
